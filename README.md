This is a simple web application that allows users to count and save the count as previous entries.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How It Works

This Counter App provides two main functionalities:

1. **Incrementing the Count**: Clicking the "INCREMENT" button increases the count by 1.

2. **Saving the Count**: Clicking the "Save" button appends the current count to the list of previous entries. The count is then reset to 0.

## Usage

To use the Counter App, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can then click the "INCREMENT" button to increase the count and the "Save" button to save the count as a previous entry.
